Store 4 textures:
    Slot0: Diffuse
    Slot1: Normal
    Slot2: Specular
    Slot3: Roughness

Use empty textures when you don't need 
the components, but don't skip them! There are empty textures in
Data/Textures/EmptyXXXTexture.png, and also included in the Material Library


baseColor:
    store in diffuse color (diffuse intensity will be multiplied with that! Usually
    you want to set Difuse>Intensity to 1.0)

NOTICE: Don't forget to set specular intensity to 1.0 ! All specular components
get multiplied with that.

specular-factor (specular texture gets multiplied with that):
    specular.x

metallic:
    specular.y

roughness (roughness texture gets multiplied with that):
    specular.z

bump-factor:
    diffuse.a
    -> Enable transparency in the material tab, select "Mask",
       and then adjust "Alpha"

You can set the specular intensity to 0 in blender so your
models keep the same color when using the specular components
for other data.

Your objects might look strange in blender, but when you followed
this instructions, they should look correct in the pipeline. You can also
look into the material library for seeing demo materials.
